# HANDOVER — session restart brief (2026-10-31)

Self-contained brief so a fresh session can continue without re-deriving anything.
Read `AGENTS.md` first for the repo map; this file is the *state of play* snapshot.

## 1. Goal

Make BG3 **Honour mode** much harder by **adding more mobs to existing encounters**
(HP-ratio tweaks were not enough). Constraints:

- Text-only editing on Linux/Proton (Windows build, `compatdata/1086940`). No Larian GUI editor.
- `Data/Public/` overlay edits = "basegame override" (live, no build step).
- Honour-mode only (`DB_HonorMode_Enabled(1)` gate, or SE-side difficulty check).
- Mark ✅ verified vs ⚠️ needs in-game test in every claim.
- **Achievements do not matter to the user** → mods + Script Extender are fully allowed.
- User wants, eventually, to fold the existing `.txt` functionality into the mod (single artifact).

## 2. Decision made this session

**Route A**: build a `.pak` for Lua + story-goal work. Keep balance/stats `.txt` overrides in
`Data/Public/` (live, no build step) and only port them into the pak later if one artifact is wanted.
Route B (loose folder in `Data/Mods/` + hand-edited `modsettings.lsx`) judged unreliable — evidence:
the user's own loose `Data/Mods/HealthBoostLocal/` folder was ignored by the game entirely.

## 3. EXPERIMENT RESULT — E7 came back NULL (important)

User ran a **new Honour game** on 2026-10-31, walked the prologue (room 2 → room 3 imp battle).
`SharedDev/Story/RawFiles/Goals/MARTIN_SpawnProbe.txt` (two ungated `CombatStarted` rules, separate
once-guards, template A = level-native `S_FirstFight_Imp_Melee_01_07f1512b-…`, template B = foreign
`Wolf_41da0eff-…`) produced **no extra mobs and nothing unusual**.

Interpretation: with E1 (honour-gated, `SharedDev`) *and* E7 (ungated, any level, both template
flavours) both silent, the mount hypothesis is now the leading explanation — i.e.
`Data/Public/<Module>/Story/RawFiles/Goals/*.txt` is **not** part of the story compile path.
Vanilla ships story text only under `Data/Mods/<Module>/Story/RawFiles/` (944 goal files, all stock).
Remaining untested sub-cases: (a) wrong mount (`Data/Public` never scanned for `Story/`),
(b) wrong module (`SharedDev` not searched for the TUT levels' goals, which live in Gustav/GustavDev),
(c) the engine never compiles loose goal text at all on this install.

⚠️ Also unconfirmed from that run: whether the **balance/stats** overrides still take effect on a new
game (user said "nothing out of the normal", which may or may not include the HP/damage edits).
Ask, and if stats are dead too, suspect the base-module choice in `modsettings.lsx` (currently
`GustavDev`, mtime 2024-08-02) before suspecting the overlay.

### E8 — next experiment, cheap, no tooling (do this first)

`Data/Mods/` is writable now (user fixed the ro bind). Put the probe where vanilla goal text
provably lives, then restart the game (story text is compiled at start, so a restart is required):

```
tools/deploy_story.sh --copy          # mirrors repo MARTIN_*.txt -> Data/Mods/<Module>/Story/RawFiles/Goals/
```

Also consider hand-copying it to `Data/Mods/GustavDev/Story/RawFiles/Goals/` as well, since the
prologue levels' goals live in Gustav/GustavDev and the base module is GustavDev — that splits
sub-case (b) from (a). Then: any combat in a new game ⇒ story channel is live from the `Data/Mods`
mount, ship goals there (and via the pak). Still nothing ⇒ loose goal text is not compiled at all;
go through the pak (and/or lslib `StoryCompiler`) instead.

## 4. Pak toolchain — where the investigation stopped

- Cloned `https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib.git` → `/tmp/opencode/pak/lslib` (⚠️ `/tmp` may be wiped;
  re-clone with `git clone --depth 1`, or put it in a gitignored `tools/vendor/lslib`).
- `LSTools.sln` projects: `LSLib`, `Divine`, `StatParser`, `StoryCompiler`, `StoryDecompiler`,
  `LSLibStats`, `RconClient`, `VTexTool`, `DebuggerFrontend`, `ConverterApp`.
- **`ConverterApp` is the only pak UI and is `net8.0-windows` (WinForms) → does not build natively here.**
- **No console project in the repo does pak pack/unpack** → plan is a ~40-line C# console app that
  references `LSLib` directly. API surface lives in:
  - `LSLib/LS/PackageReader.cs` — `class Package`, `class PackageReader`
  - `LSLib/LS/PackageWriter.cs` — `PackageWriter`, `PackageWriter_V7/V13/V15`, `PackageWriterFactory`
  - `LSLib/LS/PackageCommon.cs` — `PackagedFileInfo`
  - `LSLib/LS/PackageFormat.cs` — `PackageHeaderCommon`
  - usage example to copy: `ConverterApp/PackagePane.cs` (~lines 100–200: sets `build.Compression =
    CompressionMethod.Zstd|LZ4|Zlib`, `build.Version <= PackageVersion.V9` rules)
- `LSLib.csproj` is `net8.0` and its **PreBuildEvent runs `external/gppg/binaries/GpLex` + `Gppg`**
  (Windows binaries, not in the repo; README wants GPLex 1.2.2 + GPPG 1.5.2 zips from
  `s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/nb-stor/dos-legacy/ExportTool/`). `StoryCompiler` additionally pulls
  `Grpc.Tools`/protoc. ⚠️ Linux build may need the generated `Goal.lex.cs`/`Goal.yy.cs` handled
  manually or the tools run under wine.
- Tool inventory on this box ✅: `dotnet 8.0.424`, `wine 10.0`, `python3 3.14`, `node v24`, `go`,
  7-zip, zstd. No cargo, no mono. Network OK (GitHub API intermittently rate-limited,
  `raw.githubusercontent.com` fine).
- **Prove-before-trust step (not yet done):** round-trip an existing pak —
  `…/AppData/Local/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods/ModFixer.pak` (282 B) or
  `Automated Summons SE.pak` (47 KB). Also worth checking pak magic/compression of vanilla paks.
- Alternatives not tried: BG3 Modder's Multitool (`ShinyHobo`, WinForms, under wine), `Nefere/magical`
  (Rust CLI mod manager, cross-platform — no cargo here but releases may have Linux binaries),
  BG3 Mod Manager under Proton (Nexus guide, Oct 2025), Vilsol/bg3.

## 5. Script Extender state ✅

- SE installed and current: `bin/DWrite.dll` = "BG3 Script Extender Auto-Updater DLL (c) Norbyte";
  needs the user's `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="DWrite.dll=n,b" %command%"`. v33 "Script Extender (2026 Oct 12)".
  Game build `4.3.2.26` (also strings `4.1.1.7631656`, `4.1.311.3`).
- Logging switched on this session: `bin/ScriptExtenderSettings.json` =
  `{"CreateConsole": false,"LogEnabled": true}` (backup `ScriptExtenderSettings.json.bak`)
  → log at `bin/bg3-print.log`. **Not yet verified producing output** (game not restarted since).
- Skeleton mod built (⚠️ never loaded, because it is not packaged):
  `mods/more-mobs/Mods/MARTIN_MoreMobs/` = `meta.lsx` (UUID `d5afd252-101b-449b-ae74-c792a73d64ff`,
  `Folder=MARTIN_MoreMobs`, Version64 `36028797018963968`, TargetModes Story),
  `ScriptExtender/Config.json` (`RequiredVersion: 33`, `ModTable: MARTIN_MoreMobs`,
  `FeatureFlags:["Lua"]`), `ScriptExtender/Lua/BootstrapServer.lua`,
  `ScriptExtender/Lua/Server/Probe.lua` (logs on `SessionLoaded`, dumps every root template to
  `MARTIN_root_templates.txt` via `Ext.IO.SaveFile`, spawns imp + wolf on `CombatStarted`,
  registers `!martin_spawn`).
- Deploy helper: `tools/deploy_lua_mod.sh` (dry-run verified; Route B only — kept as fallback).
- Post-mortem of the user's dead Lua mods (`Data/Mods/HealthBoostLocal/`,
  `Data/Mods/HPChaos_…/`, also in game-root `Mods/`): no `meta.lsx` (they used `Mod.json`), not in load
  order, no `ScriptExtender/Config.json`, and invented APIs (`Ext.RegisterListener`,
  `Ext.GetDifficulty`, `Ext.StatusAdd`, `Ext.Debug`, `Ext.Random`). Safe to delete **pending user OK**.

## 6. Reference material already distilled

- `docs/spawn-chains.md` — Osiris goal channel, §3 (+§3.1.1) mount forensics and E1/E7 protocol,
  §5 primitives, §12 test walkthrough.
- `docs/lua-modding.md` — SE layout rules, load-order reality, post-mortem, spawn API table.
- `docs/vendor/bg3se-Lua-API.md` — upstream SE Lua API vendored (2013 lines, 84 KB, "v30" text for
  SE v33). **Grep this before using any `Ext.*`/`Osi.*` name.**
- `../Mods/GustavDev/Story/RawFiles/story_header.div` — authoritative signatures: `CreateAt` 507,
  `CreateAtObject` 508, `FindValidPosition` 573, `GetPosition` 543, `SetHostileAndEnterCombat` 921,
  `SetFaction` 933.
- `../Mods/Gustav/Story/RawFiles/Goals/Test.txt:345-356` — Larian's own spawn test (wolf template).
- `../Mods/Gustav/Story/RawFiles/Goals/TUT_Helm.txt:896-1010` — vanilla mid-combat reinforcements via
  `PROC_Appear` + `PROC_GLO_NarrativeCombat_JoinCombat`.
- Validators: `python3 tools/check_goal.py` (currently ok), `python3 tools/validate_treasure.py` (0 errors).

## 7. Osiris/Lua facts worth not re-deriving

- `CreateAtObject(TemplateId, Anchor, Temporary, PlaySpawn, SpawnFinishEvent, MatchOrientation, out)`;
  `CreateAt(TemplateId, X, Y, Z, Temporary, PlaySpawn, SpawnFinishEvent, out)`;
  `GetPosition(out X,Y,Z)`.
- Factions in use: `Evil_4be9261a-e481-8d9d-3528-f36956a19b17`, `Hero_a1542c81-6895-929e-4522-10ce218bb360`.
- Real SE entry points: `Ext.Require`, `Ext.Osiris.RegisterListener(name, arity, "after", fn)`,
  `Ext.Events.SessionLoaded:Subscribe`, `Osi.*`, `Osi.DB_X:Get/Delete`,
  `Ext.Template.GetAllRootTemplates()`, `Ext.Level.GetHeightsAt(x,z)`, `Ext.IO.SaveFile`,
  `Ext.RegisterConsoleCommand`, console `reset` to reload Lua VMs. Server state owns Osiris;
  SE Lua object handles expire per game loop.
- Imp-room templates named by vanilla goals: `S_FirstFight_Imp_Melee_01_07f1512b-…`,
  `…_Melee_02_5c5bd50b-…`, `…_Ranged_01_38d1ce2f-…`, `…_Ranged_02_df44fa65-…`.
- Cross-level template instantiation is still untested — second suspect for E1/E7 nulls; the SE
  template dump settles it.
- Save files (`HonourMode.lsv`, LSOF + one zstd frame) carry no `DB_` fact strings → useless for
  reading story state. No precompiled story cache anywhere (`Data/Generated/` = Public/Engine/Assets
  only). Game logs `bin/gold.*.log` / `bin/network.*.log` show no story-compile output.

## 8. Ranked next moves

1. **E8** (§3) — copy the probe into the `Data/Mods` story mount, restart, one combat. Cheapest
   decisive answer about the story channel; also ask the user whether balance stats visibly worked.
2. **Pak CLI** (§4) — tiny C# console app over LSLib `Package`/`PackageWriterFactory`; prove by
   round-tripping `ModFixer.pak`, then pack `mods/more-mobs/` (internal paths `Mods/MARTIN_MoreMobs/…`,
   `Public/MARTIN_MoreMobs/…`) into `…/AppData/Local/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods/`, enable
   in-game, read `bin/bg3-print.log` + `MARTIN_root_templates.txt`.
3. Optional big win: lslib **`StoryCompiler`** to compile `MARTIN_*.txt` offline (needs
   `story_header.div`/`story_definitions.div` + gplex/gppg) so goal grammar errors stop being silent.
4. Cleanup, pending user OK: delete dead `Data/Mods/HealthBoostLocal/` and
   `Data/Mods/HPChaos_0e6a9a3c-5b69-3e25-9d0f-75f692fc7aaa/`.
5. Do **not** install the mod pak while the user is running a new-game E7/E8 test (confounds signal).

## 9. Git state

Commits this session: `2ddd041` (E7 probe + E1 forensics), `aeadb2d` (SE/Lua docs + skeleton +
deploy script), `d09c810` (this handover + AGENTS.md pointer), plus a follow-up commit adding
`spawn-chains.md` sec.3.1.2 (E7 result, E8 plan). `bg3-vanilla-data/` is gitignored and
**absent/empty** on this checkout — re-unpack before using it as a baseline.

## 10. Session hygiene note

Late in the session, some tool calls rendered into the chat as literal text instead of executing.
Pattern observed: the calls that failed had awkward arguments (backslash escapes, `|` in regex
patterns, embedded double quotes, `>` in grep patterns); re-issued versions with plain, simple
arguments worked immediately, including `grep`, `edit`, `write`, `shell`. So: keep tool arguments
plain — short single-quoted paths, no regex alternation, no escaped quotes, no `echo` separators.
`docs/spawn-chains.md` sec.3.1.2 now carries the E7 result and the E8 plan (this file and that
section overlap on purpose: this one is the session brief, that one is the project memory).
