# BG3 'mod'

## Overview

Goto BG3 placement (Rightclick game in Steam -> Manage -> Browse Local Files)

Go into directory `Data` and clone this repo in there `git clone git@github.com:MartinUnity/games-bg3-mod.git Public`

It will create a new subdir (Public) which holds all the changed files.

Doing it this way instead of creating a proper mod allows for achivement - who gives :shrug:

## Quick sumup

This 'mod' heavily favors building weird characters with weird synergy classes as multi.

It also favors having fewer than (2 is ideal for dps-aligned builds, whereas 3 chars for a more wellrounded party with focus on non-combat skills)

4 chars become too powerfull too soon.

It also enchanced the experience by lowering the CON for all chars to 10 or 12 to keep the lvl bonus hp low.

### Key changed items:

- 10x encumberance -- now every point of str allows a char to have 10x as much stuff
- 3 short rests instead of 2
- Level cap increased from 12 -> 50
- Total XP requirements getting to 50 is about the same as getting to 12 - so leveling is 3-4x faster (slower at levels 1-20, then faster from 21-50)
- Many new passives, weapons, armors and a mix of these
  - New heavy armors with thorn like passive (reflect damage on hit)
  - Medium armors with new passives/powers (like +1/2 radiant damage on-hit)
  - Light armors with new passives (like +3/4 skill improvements to stealth/acrobatics etc)
  - Cloth armor with stat increases (single stat +1/2 or multistat +1/2)
  - Several new weapon for most tiers - mostly +2/+3 variants with either 1, 2, 1d4, 1d6 or 1d8 elemental damage pr. hit
  - Weapons with new passives
  - Missing variants with +3 versions (like Maul, Spear and Warpick)
- Changed a few existing items (like adding Guidance to the necklace received from rescuing Annabella from the druid snake)
- Changed some spells:
  - Prayer of healing is now a lvl 1 spell instead of 2 (but still requires one to be a cleric lvl3)
  - Cure light wound has been buffed significantly (+1d8 pr. lvl)
- Pets have been buffed:
  - Druid bear is now much more powerful; both in terms of abilities, stats and vitality (HP)
  - Imp (Warlock pet) has been buffed a lot
  - Ranger bear pet has been moderately buffed and can now tank much better (vitality and stats)
  - Some summons (mephits) have been slightly buffed
- Companions:
  - Most companions have recieved a minor buff to their core profiency skills (like +3 for religion for Shadow, +3 atletics for Karlach ... - no stat improvements, only one core skill pr. companion)
  - There is an easy option to change all companions to have 16 base str in the config files - disabled by default (this is for jumping power so no-one should get stuck anymore etc)

  .. prob. lots more I forgot.
